Learning Rails
==============

I [tried this before with Android](https://github.com/cmccarty/android-big-nerd) and I liked how it went for the first month or so before I completely forgot about it. Now I'm trying it again, but this time with Rails. Yes, I should probably finish what I stared on Android first, but stop judging me.

What follows is my progress as I follow the [https://www.railstutorial.org](Rails Tutorial). I plan to tag each chapter as I add notes and sample code to keep myself diciplined and to also let anyone pick up from any point if they so wish. Here we go.

*Note: If the commit dates seem like a long time ago, it's probably a git issue and definitely not me slacking off...*
